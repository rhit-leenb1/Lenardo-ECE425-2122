  Carlotta Berry 11.21.16

  This program will introduce using the stepper motor library to create motion algorithms for the robot.
  The motions will be go to angle, go to goal, move in a circle, square, figure eight and teleoperation (stop, forward, spin, reverse, turn)
  It will also include wireless commmunication for remote control of the robot by using a game controller or serial monitor.
  The primary functions created are
  goToAngle - given an angle input use odomery to sturn the rob
  goToGoal - given an x and y position in feet, use the goToAngle() function and trigonometry to move to a goal positoin
  moveCircle - given the diameter in inches and direction of clockwise or counterclockwise, move the robot in a circle with that diameter
  moveSquare - given the side length in inches, move the robot in a square with the given side length
  moveFigure8 - given the diameter in inches, use the moveCircle() function with direction input to create a Figure 8
  forward, reverse - both wheels move with same velocity, same direction
  pivot- one wheel stationary, one wheel moves forward or back
  spin - both wheels move with same velocity opposite direction
  turn - both wheels move with same direction different velocity
  stop -both wheels stationary
